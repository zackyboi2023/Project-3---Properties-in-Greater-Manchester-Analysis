## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyse properties that were located within the manchester region. On my solo journey into Greater Manchester's real estate, my main goal was to uncover the real stories behind average property prices in different neighborhoods. Beyond the numbers, I wanted to share the unique character of each area and how it's tied to the local economy and community. By diving into these prices, I aimed to provide insights that matter to people living and working here. In the end, this personal project paints a picture of Greater Manchester's identity, envisioning a future where homes are more than just buildings â€“ they're part of a community that's affordable, inclusive, and thriving.

## Project Description
In this solo endeavor, the project delves into unraveling the intricacies of Manchester's property landscape using a Kaggle dataset, employing meticulous data cleaning akin to the careful restoration of a historical artifact. The analysis phase acts as a detective, unveiling narratives within property subtypes, prices, and average values across different boroughs. Tableau serves as the canvas for visualizing spatial distribution and price variations of properties, ensuring clear communication without the need for extensive teams or complex models. Challenges, notably ensuring dataset representativeness, are met with singular dedication to capturing the essence of Manchester. Looking ahead, the project aims for gradual refinement of analysis techniques and potential incorporation of additional datasets to enrich insights while maintaining the objective of straightforward and accessible communication of findings.
